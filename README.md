Pointer_Generator_Summarizer Tensorflow 2.0.0 (V3)


The pointer generator is a deep neural network built for abstractive summarizations.

With my collaborator Kevin Sylla , we re-made this model in tensorflow for our research project. This neural net will be our baseline model.
We will do some experiments with this model, and propose a new architecture based on this one.

In this project, you can:
- train models
- test ²
- evaluate ²

This project reads .bin format files. For our experiments, we will be working on the ccn and dailymail datasets.
You can download the preprocessed files with this link :

Or do the pre-processing by yourself with this link :
